### Notes and Tools Used

---

- Expo: Of course expo was used
- React Native Paper - For the Ripple effect of buttons (Native effect is inconvenient)
- React Native swipe up down: For the swipe up and down of the Keypad Layout
- Math.JS: For the calulations
- Expo vector icons: Self explanatory
- Used Flexbox to create Keypad
- Custom Keys with values of their operators/numbers assigned to it as the value prop
- Border shadow for custom effect. [From here](https://ethercreative.github.io/react-native-shadow-generator/)
- Custom icons made possible with condition statements
- URL opened with React Native Linking
- Data passed from Child to Parent by passing down function to child as props with state defined in the parent
